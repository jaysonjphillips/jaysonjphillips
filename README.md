### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[Jayson Phillips](https://jaysonjphillips.com)  
[He/Him]. Also known as Jay Phillz... and in some places, `jsonp`.  
So you've ended up on my github profile, eh? Guess I'll share a bit more about myself.  

**work**
- Currently, a Senior Engineering Manager of Core Learner Experience over at Coursera. 
- In addition, I have a small technical consultancy and due dilligence firm called Breakpointt Studio. 
- This consultancy also is the organization through which I manage "Pull Up & Code", a twice-weekly [livestream](https://twitch.tv/its_jay_phillz) where we write code for some projects and create community for engineers of all levels. 
  - You can find more about this over at [our github profile](https://github.com/pullupandcode). 
I've been in software in some form professionally for roughly 20 years. I'm passionate about education and helping anyone with an interest in code break in.

I'm largely self-taught, and have worked in small startups, large corporations, 1 FAANG, and more. I love sharing my experiences and hoping that I can help someone. so if you've got questions regarding breaking into tech, hit me up! Actually, the livestream is probably the most immediate place you'll get answers.
